# Share Team Knowledge using Azure Project Wiki

**Estimated time:** 45 minutes

You will learn how to create and configure wikis in Azure DevOps, including managing markdown content and creating Mermaid diagrams. Azure DevOps wikis provide a centralized place for teams to share knowledge, document processes, and maintain project information.

## Before you start

You need:

- **Microsoft Edge** or an [Azure DevOps supported browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/server/compatibility)
- **Azure DevOps organization:** Create one if you don't have one
- **eShopOnWeb project:** Use the sample project from previous labs or create a new one

## About Azure DevOps Wikis

Azure DevOps provides two types of wikis:

1. **Project wiki** - A wiki that exists separately from your repositories
2. **Code wiki** - A wiki created from content stored in a Git repository

Key features:

- **Markdown support** with rich formatting capabilities
- **Mermaid diagrams** for creating flowcharts and sequence diagrams
- **Image support** with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Version control** with revision history
- **Cross-reference links** to work items, code, and other wikis
- **Collaborative editing** with concurrent user support

## Set up the project and repository

First, ensure you have the eShopOnWeb project ready for this lab.

### Set up Azure DevOps organization (if needed)

If you don't already have an Azure DevOps organization, follow these steps:

1. Use a private browser session to get a new **personal Microsoft Account (MSA)** at `https://account.microsoft.com` (skip if you already have one).
1. Using the same browser session, sign up for a free Azure subscription at `https://azure.microsoft.com/free` (skip if you already have one).
1. Open a browser and navigate to Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com`, then search at the top of the Azure portal screen for **Azure DevOps**. In the resulting page, select **Azure DevOps organizations**.
1. Next, select the link labelled **My Azure DevOps Organizations** or navigate directly to `https://aex.dev.azure.com`.
1. On the **We need a few more details** page, select **Continue**.
1. In the drop-down box on the left, choose **Default Directory**, instead of **Microsoft Account**.
1. If prompted (_"We need a few more details"_), provide your name, e-mail address, and location and select **Continue**.
1. Back at `https://aex.dev.azure.com` with **Default Directory** selected select the blue button **Create new organization**.
1. Accept the _Terms of Service_ by selecting **Continue**.
1. If prompted (_"Almost done"_), leave the name for the Azure DevOps organization at default (it needs to be a globally unique name) and pick a hosting location close to you from the list.
1. Once the newly created organization opens in **Azure DevOps**, select **Organization settings** in the bottom left corner.
1. At the **Organization settings** screen select **Billing** (opening this screen takes a few seconds).
1. Select **Setup billing** and on the right-hand side of the screen, select your **Azure Subscription** and then select **Save** to link the subscription with the organization.
1. Once the screen shows the linked Azure Subscription ID at the top, change the number of **Paid parallel jobs** for **MS Hosted CI/CD** from 0 to **1**. Then select **SAVE** button at the bottom.

   > **Note**: You may **wait a couple of minutes before using the CI/CD capabilities** so that the new settings are reflected in the backend. Otherwise, you will still see the message _"No hosted parallelism has been purchased or granted"_.

1. In **Organization Settings**, go to section **Pipelines** and select **Settings**.
1. Toggle the switch to **Off** for **Disable creation of classic build pipelines** and **Disable creation of classic release pipelines**.
1. In **Organization Settings**, go to section **Security** and select **Policies**.
1. Toggle the switch to **On** for **Allow public projects**.

### Create and configure the Azure DevOps project (if needed)

1. Open your browser and navigate to your Azure DevOps organization.
1. Select the **New Project** option and use the following settings:
   - name: **eShopOnWeb**
   - visibility: **Private**
   - Advanced: Version Control: **Git**
   - Advanced: Work Item Process: **Scrum**
1. Select **Create**.

### Import eShopOnWeb git repository (if needed)

1. Open the previously created **eShopOnWeb** project.
1. Select the **Repos > Files**, **Import a Repository** and then select **Import**.
1. On the **Import a Git Repository** window, paste the following URL `https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/eShopOnWeb.git` and select **Import**:

   ![Screenshot of the import repository panel.](media/import-repo.png)

1. The repository is organized the following way:

   - **.ado** folder contains Azure DevOps YAML pipelines.
   - **.devcontainer** folder container setup to develop using containers (either locally in VS Code or GitHub Codespaces).
   - **.azure** folder contains Bicep & ARM infrastructure as code templates.
   - **.github** folder container YAML GitHub workflow definitions.
   - **src** folder contains the .NET 8 website used on the lab scenarios.

1. Leave the web browser window open.
1. Go to **Repos > Branches**.
1. Hover on the **main** branch then select the ellipsis on the right of the column.
1. Select **Set as default branch**.

### Download brand image for later use

1. In the **Files** pane, expand the **src** folder and browse to **Web > wwwroot > images** subfolder
2. In the **Images** subfolder, locate the **brand.png** entry
3. Hover over its right end to reveal the vertical ellipsis (three dots) menu
4. Select **Download** to download the **brand.png** file to your local computer

> **Note**: You will use this image in the next exercise.

### Create a Documents folder

1. From within **Repos**, select **Files**
2. Notice the **eShopOnWeb** Repo title on top of the folder structure
3. **Select the ellipsis (3 dots)**, Choose **New > Folder**
4. Provide **`Documents`** as title for the New Folder name
5. As a repo doesn't allow empty folders, provide **`README.md`** as New File name
6. Select **Create** to confirm the creation
7. The README.md file will open in view mode
8. Select the **Commit** button to save the changes
9. In the Commit window, confirm by pressing **Commit**

   | Repository | **eShopOnWeb**               |
   | Branch     | **main**                     |
   | Folder     | **/Documents**               |
   | Wiki name  | **`eShopOnWeb (Documents)`** |

This will automatically open the Wiki section with the editor.

> **Note**: If the editor doesn't open automatically, select **+ New page** at the bottom of the file explorer.

### Create wiki content

3. This sample text demonstrates several common Markdown syntax features:

   - **Titles and subtitles** (## and ###)
   - **Bold text** (\*\*)
   - **Italic text** (\*)
   - **Numbered lists** (1.)
   - **Bullet lists** (-)
   - **Tables** with headers and data

4. Once finished, press the **Save** button in the upper right corner

5. **Refresh** your browser, or select any other DevOps portal option and return to the Wiki section

6. Notice you are now presented with the **eShopOnWeb (Documents)** Wiki, with **Welcome to our Online Retail Store** as the **HomePage**

### Manage published wiki content

1. In the vertical menu on the left side, select **Repos**
2. Ensure the dropdown menu displays the **eShopOnWeb** repo and **main** branch
3. In the repo folder hierarchy, select the **Documents** folder
4. Select the **Welcome-to-our-Online-Retail-Store!.md** file
5. Notice how the Markdown format is visible as raw text, allowing you to edit the file content from here as well

> **Note**: Since the Wiki source files are handled as source code, all traditional source control practices (Clone, Pull Requests, Approvals, etc.) can be applied to Wiki pages.

## Create and manage a project wiki

You can create and manage wikis independently of existing repositories. This provides flexibility for documentation that doesn't need to be version-controlled with your code.

### Create a project wiki with Mermaid diagram

1. In the Azure DevOps portal, navigate to the **Wiki** pane of the **eShopOnWeb** project
2. With the **eShopOnWeb (Documents)** wiki content selected, select the dropdown list header at the top
3. In the dropdown list, select **Create new project wiki**
4. In the **Page title** text box, type: `Project Design`
5. Place the cursor in the body of the page
6. Select the left-most icon in the toolbar (header setting) and select **Header 1**
7. This adds the hash character (**#**) at the beginning of the line
8. After the **#** character, type: `Authentication and Authorization` and press **Enter**
9. Select the header setting icon again and select **Header 2**
10. After the **##** characters, type: `Azure DevOps OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flow` and press **Enter**

### Add a Mermaid diagram

Mermaid is a diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create diagrams dynamically.

1. **Copy and paste** the following code to insert a Mermaid diagram:

   ```text
   ::: mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant A as Your app
    participant D as Azure DevOps
    U->>A: Use your app
    A->>D: Request authorization for user
    D-->>U: Request authorization
    U->>D: Grant authorization
    D-->>A: Send authorization code
    A->>D: Get access token
    D-->>A: Send access token
    A->>D: Call REST API with access token
    D-->>A: Respond to REST API
    A-->>U: Relay REST API response
   :::
   ```

> **Note**: For details about Mermaid syntax, refer to [About Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)

2. In the preview pane, select **Load diagram** and review the outcome
3. The output should resemble a flowchart that illustrates [OAuth 2.0 authorization flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/oauth)

### Save with revision message

1. In the upper right corner of the editor pane, select the down-facing caret next to the **Save** button
2. In the dropdown menu, select **Save with revision message**

4. Select **Save**

### Add an image section

1. Place the cursor at the end of the Mermaid element and press **Enter** to add a new line
2. Select the header setting icon and select **Header 2**
3. After the **##** characters, type: `User Interface` and press **Enter**
4. In the toolbar, select the paper clip icon representing **Insert a file**
5. In the **Open** dialog box, navigate to where you downloaded the **brand.png** file
6. Select the **brand.png** file and select **Open**
7. Review the preview pane and verify that the image displays properly
8. Select the down-facing caret next to **Save** and select **Save with revision message**
9. In the **Save page** dialog box, type: `User Interface section with the eShopOnWeb image`
10. Select **Save**
11. In the upper right corner, select **Close**

## Manage a project wiki

You'll now learn how to manage wiki content, including reverting changes and organizing pages.

### Revert changes using revision history

1. With the **Project Design** wiki selected, in the upper right corner, select the vertical ellipsis symbol
2. In the dropdown menu, select **View revisions**
3. On the **Revisions** pane, select the entry representing the most recent change
4. On the resulting pane, review the comparison between the previous and current version
5. Select **Revert**
6. When prompted for confirmation, select **Revert** again
7. Then select **Browse Page**
8. Back on the **Project Design** pane, verify that the change was successfully reverted

### Add and organize wiki pages

1. On the **Project Design** pane, at the bottom left corner, select **+ New page**
2. In the **Page title** text box, type: `Project Design Overview`
3. Select **Save**, then select **Close**
4. Back in the pane listing the pages within the **Project Design** project wiki, locate the **Project Design Overview** entry
5. Select it with the mouse pointer and drag and drop it above the **Project Design** page entry
6. Verify that the **Project Design Overview** entry is listed as the top level page with the home icon designating it as the wiki home page

## Best practices for wiki management

- **Use clear, descriptive titles** for pages and sections
- **Organize content hierarchically** with proper heading levels
- **Link between pages** using wiki syntax `[[Page Name]]`
- **Include images and diagrams** to enhance understanding
- **Use tables** for structured data presentation
- **Maintain consistency** in formatting and style
- **Review and update content regularly** to keep it current
- **Use revision messages** to track changes meaningfully
