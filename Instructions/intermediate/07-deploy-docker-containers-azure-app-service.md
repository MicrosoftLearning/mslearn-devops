# Deploy Docker containers to Azure App Service web apps

In this lab, you'll learn how to use an Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline to build a custom Docker image, push it to Azure Container Registry, and deploy it as a container to Azure App Service. You'll work with containerization, Azure Container Registry, and automated deployments.

You will learn how to:

- Build a custom Docker image using a Microsoft hosted Linux agent.
- Push an image to Azure Container Registry.
- Deploy a Docker image as a container to Azure App Service using Azure DevOps.
- Configure CI/CD pipelines for containerized applications.
- Test containerized web applications in Azure.

This lab takes approximately **20** minutes to complete.

## Before you start

To complete the lab, you need:

- **Microsoft Edge** or an [Azure DevOps supported browser.](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/server/compatibility)
- An Azure DevOps organization. If you don't already have one, create one by following the instructions at [Create an organization or project collection](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization).
- **An Azure subscription**: If you don't already have an Azure subscription, sign up for a free account at [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
- Verify that you have a Microsoft account or a Microsoft Entra account with the **Contributor** or the **Owner** role in the Azure subscription. For details, refer to [List Azure role assignments using the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-list-portal) and [View and assign administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/roles/manage-roles-portal).

### Set up Azure DevOps organization (if needed)

If you don't already have an Azure DevOps organization, follow these steps:

1. Use a private browser session to get a new **personal Microsoft Account (MSA)** at `https://account.microsoft.com` (skip if you already have one).
1. Using the same browser session, sign up for a free Azure subscription at `https://azure.microsoft.com/free` (skip if you already have one).
1. Open a browser and navigate to Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com`, then search at the top of the Azure portal screen for **Azure DevOps**. In the resulting page, select **Azure DevOps organizations**.
1. Next, select the link labelled **My Azure DevOps Organizations** or navigate directly to `https://aex.dev.azure.com`.
1. On the **We need a few more details** page, select **Continue**.
1. In the drop-down box on the left, choose **Default Directory**, instead of **Microsoft Account**.
1. If prompted (_"We need a few more details"_), provide your name, e-mail address, and location and select **Continue**.
1. Back at `https://aex.dev.azure.com` with **Default Directory** selected select the blue button **Create new organization**.
1. Accept the _Terms of Service_ by selecting **Continue**.
1. If prompted (_"Almost done"_), leave the name for the Azure DevOps organization at default (it needs to be a globally unique name) and pick a hosting location close to you from the list.
1. Once the newly created organization opens in **Azure DevOps**, select **Organization settings** in the bottom left corner.
1. At the **Organization settings** screen select **Billing** (opening this screen takes a few seconds).
1. Select **Setup billing** and on the right-hand side of the screen, select your **Azure Subscription** and then select **Save** to link the subscription with the organization.
1. Once the screen shows the linked Azure Subscription ID at the top, change the number of **Paid parallel jobs** for **MS Hosted CI/CD** from 0 to **1**. Then select **SAVE** button at the bottom.

   > **Note**: You may **wait a couple of minutes before using the CI/CD capabilities** so that the new settings are reflected in the backend. Otherwise, you will still see the message _"No hosted parallelism has been purchased or granted"_.

1. In **Organization Settings**, go to section **Pipelines** and select **Settings**.
1. Toggle the switch to **Off** for **Disable creation of classic build pipelines** and **Disable creation of classic release pipelines**.
1. In **Organization Settings**, go to section **Security** and select **Policies**.
1. Toggle the switch to **On** for **Allow public projects**.

### Create and configure the Azure DevOps project (if needed)

1. Open your browser and navigate to your Azure DevOps organization.
1. Select the **New Project** option and use the following settings:
   - name: **eShopOnWeb**
   - visibility: **Private**
   - Advanced: Version Control: **Git**
   - Advanced: Work Item Process: **Scrum**
1. Select **Create**.

### Import eShopOnWeb git repository (if needed)

1. Open the previously created **eShopOnWeb** project.
1. Select the **Repos > Files**, **Import a Repository** and then select **Import**.
1. On the **Import a Git Repository** window, paste the following URL `https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/eShopOnWeb.git` and select **Import**:

1. The repository is organized the following way:

   - **.ado** folder contains Azure DevOps YAML pipelines.
   - **.devcontainer** folder container setup to develop using containers (either locally in VS Code or GitHub Codespaces).
   - **infra** folder contains Bicep & ARM infrastructure as code templates used in some lab scenarios.
   - **.github** folder contains YAML GitHub workflow definitions.
   - **src** folder contains the .NET 8 website used in the lab scenarios.

1. Leave the web browser window open.
1. Go to **Repos > Branches**.
1. Hover on the **main** branch then select the ellipsis on the right of the column.
1. Select **Set as default branch**.

## Import and run the CI pipeline

In this section, you will configure the service connection with your Azure Subscription then import and run the CI pipeline.

### Import and run the CI pipeline

1. Go to **Pipelines > Pipelines**
1. Select **New pipeline** button (or **Create Pipeline** if you don't have other pipelines previously created)
1. Select **Azure Repos Git (YAML)**
1. Select the **eShopOnWeb** repository
1. Select **Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file**
1. Select the **main** branch and the **/.ado/eshoponweb-ci-docker.yml** file, then select **Continue**
1. In the YAML pipeline definition, customize:

   - **YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID** with your Azure subscription ID.
   - Replace the **resourceGroup** with the resource group name you want to use, for example, **AZ400-RG1**.

1. Review the pipeline definition. The CI definition consists of the following tasks:

   - **Resources**: It downloads the repository files that will be used in the following tasks.
   - **AzureResourceManagerTemplateDeployment**: Deploys the Azure Container Registry using bicep template.
   - **PowerShell**: Retrieve the **ACR Login Server** value from the previous task's output and create a new parameter **acrLoginServer**
   - [**Docker**](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/docker-v0?view=azure-pipelines) **- Build**: Build the Docker image and create two tags (Latest and current BuildID)
   - **Docker - Push**: Push the images to Azure Container Registry

1. Select **Save and Run**.

1. Open the pipeline execution. If you see a warning message "This pipeline needs permission to access a resource before this run can continue to Build", select **View** and then **Permit** and **Permit** again. This will allow the pipeline to access the Azure subscription.

   > **Note**: The deployment may take a few minutes to complete.

1. Your pipeline will take a name based on the project name. Let's **rename** it for identifying the pipeline better. Go to **Pipelines > Pipelines** and select the recently created pipeline. Select the ellipsis and **Rename/move** option. Name it **eshoponweb-ci-docker** and select **Save**.

1. Navigate to the [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com), search for the Azure Container Registry in the recently created Resource Group (it should be named **AZ400-RG1**). On the left-hand side select **Repositories** under **Services** and make sure that the repository **eshoponweb/web** was created. When you select the repository link, you should see two tags (one of them is **latest**), these are the pushed images. If you don't see this, check the status of your pipeline.

## Import and run the CD pipeline

In this section, you will configure the service connection with your Azure Subscription then import and run the CD pipeline.

### Import and run the CD pipeline

In this task, you will import and run the CD pipeline.

1. Go to **Pipelines > Pipelines**
1. Select **New pipeline** button
1. Select **Azure Repos Git (YAML)**
1. Select the **eShopOnWeb** repository
1. Select **Existing Azure Pipelines YAML File**
1. Select the **main** branch and the **/.ado/eshoponweb-cd-webapp-docker.yml** file, then select **Continue**
1. In the YAML pipeline definition, customize:

   - **YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID** with your Azure subscription ID.
   - Replace the **resourceGroup** with the resource group name used during the service connection creation, for example, **AZ400-RG1**.
   - Replace **location** with the Azure region where the resources will be deployed.

1. Review the pipeline definition. The CD definition consists of the following tasks:

   - **Resources**: It downloads the repository files that will be used in the following tasks.
   - **AzureResourceManagerTemplateDeployment**: Deploys the Azure App Service using bicep template.
   - **AzureResourceManagerTemplateDeployment**: Add role assignment using Bicep

1. Select **Save and Run**.

1. Open the pipeline execution. If you see a warning message "This pipeline needs permission to access a resource before this run can continue to Deploy", select **View** and then **Permit** and **Permit** again. This will allow the pipeline to access the Azure subscription.

   > **Important**: If you do not authorize the pipeline when configuring, you will encounter permission errors during execution. Common error messages include "This pipeline needs permission to access a resource" or "Pipeline run failed due to insufficient permissions". To resolve this, navigate to the pipeline run, select **View** next to the permission request, then select **Permit** to grant the necessary access to your Azure subscription and resources.

   > **Note**: The deployment may take a few minutes to complete.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you receive the error message "TF402455: Pushes to this branch are not permitted; you must use a pull request to update this branch.", you need to uncheck the "Require a minimum number of reviewers" Branch protection rule enabled in the previous labs.

1. Your pipeline will take a name based on the project name. Let's **rename** it for identifying the pipeline better. Go to **Pipelines > Pipelines** and hover on the recently created pipeline. Select the ellipsis and **Rename/move** option. Name it **eshoponweb-cd-webapp-docker** and select **Save**.

   > **Note 1**: The use of the **/infra/webapp-docker.bicep** template creates an app service plan, a web app with system assigned managed identity enabled, and references the Docker image pushed previously: **${acr.properties.loginServer}/eshoponweb/web:latest**.

   > **Note 2**: The use of the **/infra/webapp-to-acr-roleassignment.bicep** template creates a new role assignment for the web app with AcrPull role to be able to retrieve the Docker image. This could be done in the first template, but since the role assignment can take some time to propagate, it's a good idea to do both tasks separately.

### Test the solution

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the recently created Resource Group, you should now see three resources (App Service, App Service Plan and Container Registry).

1. Navigate to the App Service, then select **Browse**, this will take you to the website.

1. Verify that the eShopOnWeb application is running successfully. Once confirmed, you have completed the lab successfully.

## Clean up resources

When you complete the lab, it's important to clean up your Azure resources to avoid unnecessary charges:

### Delete the Azure resources

1. In the Azure Portal at `https://portal.azure.com`, navigate to the **Resource groups** section.
1. Find and select the **AZ400-RG1** resource group (or the name you used).
1. On the resource group page, select **Delete resource group**.
1. Type the resource group name to confirm deletion and select **Delete**.
1. Wait for the deletion process to complete.

### Clean up Azure DevOps resources

You don't need to clean up your Azure DevOps organization or project, as they will remain available for you to use as a reference and portfolio item. Azure DevOps provides free tier usage that includes basic features for small teams.

If you want to delete the project, you can do so by following these steps:

1. In your browser navigate to the Azure DevOps portal at `https://aex.dev.azure.com`.
1. Navigate to the **eShopOnWeb** project you created.
1. On the project settings page, go to **Overview** and select **Delete** at the bottom of the page.
1. Type the project name to confirm deletion and select **Delete**.

> **CAUTION:** Deleting a project deletes all work items, repositories, builds, and other project artifacts. If you used an existing project for this exercise, any existing resources outside the scope of this exercise will also be deleted.

> **IMPORTANT**: Remember to delete the Azure resources to avoid unnecessary charges. The Azure DevOps project can remain as part of your portfolio.
